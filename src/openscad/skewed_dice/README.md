Asymmetric Trigonal Trapezohedral Dice

I could not find any good equations on the web, so I rolled (ahem) my own. The skewedness of the dice is controlled by parameters _u_ and _w_, such that _u^2 + w^2 - u*w = 1_.  Look in the source code for the derivation.

Theoretically, the dice are fair. In practice, imperfections in the printing and density unisotropism in the horizontal/vertical directions would break the fairness. By how much is left as an exrcise to the reader. 

Shown are a 3D printed pair of enantiomers. Height ~17mm, white PLA filament, 100% fill, .1mm layers, Ultimaker 2+. Colored the pips black with a regular SharpieÂ® marker. I should probably have sanded them first and used a clear coat, so that the ink would not get drawn along the print lines.
