Asymmetric Trigonal Trapezohedral Dice

Inspired by https://www.instagram.com/p/CX_3PrYvuGg/.

I could not find any good equations on the web, so I rolled (ahem) my own.

Theoretically, the dice are fair.

Shown are a 3D printed pair of enantiomers. Height ~20mm, 100% fill, .1mm layer, Ultimaker 2+. Colored the pips black with some cheap goth nail polish.
