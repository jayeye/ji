# JI's stuff

It should be obvious what is mine and what isn't in this repo.

What I've written is licensed under the Beer License (if you found it
useful, buy me a beer when you see me). Feel free to modify or even
sell anything you find in here, just be so kind as to mention me as
the originator. If you can make money out of it, just buy me two beers!
